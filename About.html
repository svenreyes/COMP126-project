      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in June 2015, The Clean Queen began as a one-house-a-day service driven by a passion for cleanliness and community impact.  
        From the outset, its mission combined high-quality home care with the empowerment of local women who faced barriers to traditional employment.  
        What started as a single-operator venture has since grown into a dedicated team of eight professionals, each committed to delivering exceptional service.  
        Every cleaning appointment is approached with unwavering attention to detail, ensuring every home is treated with care, respect, and eco-friendly products.
